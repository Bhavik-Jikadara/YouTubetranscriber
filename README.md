# YouTube transcript to detailed summary converter

* A YouTube transcript summarizer is a tool that helps you quickly grasp the key points of a YouTube video without having to watch the entire thing. It works by extracting the transcript of the video (either automatically or by using the closed captions if available) and then using sophisticated text analysis techniques to condense it into a shorter, more manageable format.

## How it works:
* Transcript acquisition: The summarizer might use different methods like YouTube API, automatic speech recognition, or existing closed captions to get the transcript.
Text analysis: Techniques like sentence scoring, keyword extraction, and topic modelling are used to identify the most important parts of the transcript.
Summary generation: The extracted key points are condensed into a shorter, more readable format using the Google Gemini Pro model.
